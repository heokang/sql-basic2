# SQL Practice: Hospital Reservation System

A practice project to learn and apply SQL basics using a hospital reservation system scenario.

## What I practiced
- Basic SQL commands: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- Table creation and schema design (`CREATE TABLE`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`)
- Data types and constraints
- Joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN` for combining multiple tables
- Aggregation functions: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- Subqueries and nested SELECTs
- Auto-increment primary keys
- Triggers for automatic data insertion
- Simple statistics and reporting queries

## Database Concept
Designed a simplified system for managing:
- Patients and reservation data
- Surgery schedules and doctors
- Daily and monthly revenue reports

## Tool
- Mysql
- java ui (for demonstration)

## Note
This project is for educational purposes.
